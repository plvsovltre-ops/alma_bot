# Citizen science release readiness

This note supports a future unrestricted public release of ALMA Monitor as a
reusable citizen science reference implementation. It does not negate the
existing closed operational pilot and does not claim United Nations endorsement.
Current status is recorded in [Operational status](OPERATIONAL_STATUS.md).

## Public release boundary

Publish code, deployment instructions, a synthetic GIS project, and a synthetic
incident dataset. Keep the production Mergin Maps project private.

Do not publish volunteer email addresses, phone numbers, exact locations of
vulnerable sites, original photo EXIF data, access credentials, or raw complaint
texts that can identify a person.

## Minimum data protocol

For each published observation, record:

1. A stable observation ID.
2. Observation date and collection method.
3. Generalised location and coordinate reference system.
4. Incident category and controlled vocabulary.
5. Evidence type and consent status.
6. Validation status, validator role, and validation date.
7. Dataset version, licence, and data quality limitations.

Keep the unmodified source record, the validation record, and the published
record as separate data products. This makes the publication traceable.

## AI safeguards

- The AI response is a draft, not a legal decision.
- The output must cite the supplied legal source title and section when possible.
- A trained reviewer must approve a complaint before official submission.
- Store the model name, prompt version, source set version, and processing time.
- Test Russian and Kazakh output with native-language reviewers.

## Open package status

Present in the `1.4.0-rc1` governance proposal:

- Apache-2.0 for software and CC BY 4.0 for original documentation;
- `AUTHORS`, `NOTICE`, `CITATION.cff`, and name-use rules;
- `SECURITY.md` and a private reporting contact;
- privacy and current-state retention documentation;
- English installation and operations guidance in `README.md`;
- automated tests for schemas, hash-bound legal governance, fail-closed public
  mode, and duplicate delivery protection.

Still required before opening unrestricted public field collection:

- exact binding of the deployed legal package to its applicable independent
  review and final decision; the existing Legal Core v1 overlay already has
  these records, while any changed governed package requires a new exact review;
- an operator-specific privacy notice and enforced retention/deletion settings;
- documented provenance and permitted use for every published spatial layer;
- an English field collection guide;
- a reproducible end-to-end demonstration containing synthetic data only.

## Alignment evidence

Document data quality, provenance, inclusion, privacy protection, and the limits
of citizen-generated observations. These items support use with the United
Nations guidance for citizen data and the Copenhagen Framework on Citizen Data.
